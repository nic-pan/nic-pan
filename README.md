ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nicole.

I create things. Sometimes code, sometimes design, often a mix of both. I like things clean, intentional, and unmistakably mine.

GitHub is where I share experiments, side projects, and creative coding work. For design explorations, I post on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/nic_pan)

âœ¨ About Me

Developer of apps, websites, and digital tools.

Enthusiastic about thoughtful design, clarity, and simplicity

ðŸŒ± Learning & Growing

Improving in React + Next.js + TypeScript

Experimenting with AI-assisted tools for productivity and design

ðŸ’¡ What Drives Me

Iâ€™m drawn to work that balances creativity with structureâ€”projects that stand out subtly, like a thoughtful signature in a crowd.
